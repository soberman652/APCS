Description:
Relive your hormonal teenage years by playing this adventure game simulating the high school experience. 
You have been bored with your recent extracurriculars and you want a change. You decide to change your extracurriculars 
and start fresh, and take on new classes. Or, maybe you are sitting through Mr. Shelby's class and this program has been 
shoved in front of your face. To get through high school, you need to do well in all of your newly chosen class 
and your extracurricular while keeping your stress levels at bay. As a new student of Homestead High School, choose from a 
variety of classes to fill your school day. Will you pass them with flying colors, or crack under pressure? Then after school, 
participate in any extracurricular activity of your choice, which is manifested as a small minigame. In one day, build your grade 
average by taking quizzes and minigames. You need to keep your stress level down by doing well on these tasks. To pass high school, 
you need to keep your stress levels low and your grades high. The worse you do on these tasks, the more stressed you get. If you 
do end up maxing out your stress tolerance, it is game over for you. Everything you do will most likely increase your stress levels. 
Anyone eager to reminisce their high school years or is a current high school student might find some interest in a simulation of high
school life.


Instructions:
Start Screen - click on the start button
Customization Screen 
	- build your student by selecting its gender, name, a class to study, and one afterschool activity from the drop-downs
	- click the done button after making your choices
Game Window
- Starting the day
	Right now, you've already woken up from your bed and are prepared to go to school. Honestly, you have no motivation to drag 
	your sleepy corpse out of your house and to school, but your young and growing body can still move around by using the arrow
	keys. To go to school, you walk to the gaping hole in the wall of your room that is somehow perfectly your size, and enter 
	through it by pressing SPACE. This is how you will walk through doors from now on - deal with it.
- At school
	Oh neat, that strange opening from your wall magically teleported you to school. You don't need to care about traffic anymore.
	Welcome to the Student Center! Since you have no sense of direction, guide your way through this remarkably small campus with
	your handy-dandy map once you hold down SHIFT. Hover your mouse over the rooms shown in the map to find the room you're looking 
	for. The red arrow shows what room you are currently in and the direction (north, south, east, west) that you are facing. Sadly, 
	your poor peripheral vision lets you see the entire floor and only one wall at a time (You should see a doctor - that's not how 
	human vision works) But don't fret - to change which direction you're facing, press D to turn clockwise and A to turn counter-
	clockwise. Also, don't be scared if you start having a seizure when crash into the walls - just stay away from them and you'll
	be fine. It seems like this kind of school doesn't have any enforcement or fixed schedule, so feel free to explore around.
- Stage
	- Music Minigame
		Music is an art form, in which one paints sound on a canvas of silence. So it makes sense to partake in the eloquent art of
		music without any sound. Black circles will scroll up your screen and you are trying to punch their corresponding numbers on
		the keyboard (not the numpad - the ones above the letters)once they hit the red line. Can you guess the tune that these lines
		and circles are attempting to recreate?
- Gym
	See that humongous basketball? Don't be scared, it won't hurt you. Walk towards it to play a little bit of basketball.
	- Basketball Game
		You've stepped onto the basketball court. Seems like the creators of this were too lazy to give you any features resembling 
		of a human, so please bear with being a box for now. Move around the court with the WASD keys and use your mouse to direct 
		the giant red rod that is protruding out your rectangular body. Hold on, this is supposed to be basketball, so why is there 
		a circle the size of a ping-pong ball? If you see a tiny ball attached to yourself right now, adjust the rod at the angle you 
		want to shoot the ball at and press SPACE to release the ball. Your goal is to toss that ping-pong ball into the net that is 
		as large as your body. Don't cheat by shooting the ball from underneath the net. If you come into contact with a moving ball,
		the ball will magnetically be pulled into your hands. (Wait, is it even a basketball anymore?) There is no target goal or mission
		in this game. You're just shooting hoops however you please.
- Classroom
	You may not even be enrolled in this school, because you don't have an assigned homeroom. There aren't any teachers here either. Did 
	they go out on a strike? Whatever, just saunter into any one of the shady dark openings in the walls. Since the school is sort of 
	short of some funding, the only thing that will count as your education is a simple quiz. Walk to the giant piece of paper to take a quiz.
	- Quiz
		You have an unlimited amount of time to answer 20 multiple choice questions that are related to your chosen subject, so you should 
		easily get a perfect score, right? Just remember, anything less than an A will increase your stress. But who cares anyway, as long 
		as you still have your health and happiness? It's not like some bubbles on an answer sheet can affect your self-confidence and possibly 
		shorten your life span from excessive stress?
