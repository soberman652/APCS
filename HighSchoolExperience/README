Description:
Relive your hormonal teenage years by playing this adventure game simulating the high school experience. 
You have been bored with your recent extracurriculars and you want a change. You decide to change your extracurriculars 
and start fresh, and take on new classes. To get through high school, you need to do well in all of your newly chosen classes 
and your extracurriculars while keeping your stress levels at bay. As a new student of Homestead High School, choose from a 
variety of classes to fill your school day. Will you pass them with flying colors, or crack under pressure? Then after school, 
participate in any extracurricular activity you choose. Everyday, there is a test and an assignment to test your skills in your 
extracurricular. You need to keep your stress level down by doing well on these tasks. To pass high school, you need to keep 
your stress levels low and your grades high. Everything you do will most likely increase your stress levels, and you have no 
control over the random events that affect your life. The course of the game is over 20 days. Anyone eager to reminisce their 
high school years or is a current high school student might enjoy playing this game that takes the user through high school life.


Instructions:
Begin the school year as a student. Select your gender and enter your name into the name box. Choose classes from a list of 
subjects and one after school activity. On Day 1, step-by-step instructions will guide the user throughout the day. The user 
will receive their course schedule and attend classes without being tardy. While attending class, student must complete assignments, 
quizzes, or tasks by playing a mini-game and get the highest grade possible. During the middle of the day, a break period will 
be given the student to recuperate and cut down on their stress. At the end of each day, the student will report to the appropriate 
location on the school campus and begin doing tasks for their after school activity. Failure in to do well in any tasks will affect 
the student stress bar. If the stress bar reaches a certain point, the user loses the game and the game stops. If the user can keep 
their student below the losing point and their grades above a C after 20 days, the game is complete, and a diploma will be given to 
the user. If the user fails school, then no diploma will be rewarded to the user, and the user simply loses the game. Regardless of 
the result, the user gets an option to start another school year or quit the game. Use all of the arrow keys to move the character up and down,
left and right. Move your character to the door to get to the next location.
